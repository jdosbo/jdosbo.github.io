Welcome to Joe Osborn's personal webpage!

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who works in research software engineering. I work as a software scientist mostly in high-energy particle physics, developing software for experiments to do data analysis. I enjoy all things combining software and science!

My research is primarily focused on studying one of four fundamental forces, the strong force, responsible for binding protons, neutrons, and their constituents together. The proton is comprised of other particles, called quarks and gluons, and this research aims to understand the interactions of these particles.

I also research methods for developing and writing common software for experiments, and work on the implementation of common software. These software initiatives enable science, like the above (and much more!), to be performed at particle accelerator facilities across the globe.
