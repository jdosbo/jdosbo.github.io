Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who works in research software engineering. I have worked as a high-energy particle physicist as a postdoc and a graduate student, largely developing software for the experiments to do data analysis. I enjoy all things combining software and science!
