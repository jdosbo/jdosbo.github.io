Welcome to Joe Osborn's personal webpage!

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who works in research software engineering. I work as a software scientist mostly in high-energy particle physics, developing software for experiments to do data analysis. I enjoy all things combining software and science!
